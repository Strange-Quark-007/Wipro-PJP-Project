  <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>Not including the assignments and mini projects as they were fairly easy.<p>
    <br>
    <p>This project is a nice package that covered concepts of Core Java, OOPS, JDBC, Database etc and hope you find it helpful.</p>
    <p>The project is not exactly same as asked; it has my own little twist, which I did when reusing this project for a Web App.</p>
